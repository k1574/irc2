irc2 - IRC client

## Description.
irc2 is an RC client.  It reads commands from
standard input and prints all server output to standard output. It multiplexes
also all channel traffic into one output, that you don't have to switch
different channel buffers, that's actually a feature.

Based on "sic" made by Suckless.
